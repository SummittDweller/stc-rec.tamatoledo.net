The STC Recreational Program was established in 1976. It is a nonprofit organization and is supported by the taxpayers of Tama and Toledo. STC REC is available to all youth in grades K-8 within the STC School District. The REC program strives to improve program availability, facilities, and equipment. Some past improvements include: adding a batting cage, scoreboards, and fencing improvements. STC REC is managed by a board of seven member/volunteers who meet regularly. If a person is interested in becoming a board member, contact a board member or the board president.

Several recreational programs are offered to the youth throughout the year. In September youth can participate in flag football and soccer. Starting in October K-6 youth may participate in the BluePride basketball. In the spring 3-6 grade youth may participate in softball and baseball (extends into the summer season too). In the summer K-8 youth may participate in t-ball, golf, soccer, tennis, and volleyball. STC REC Program strives to make REC affordable for families while continuing to be financially responsible. The cost for each activity is $25 except for those sports with longer seasons. A free t-shirt is also included for each sport. Transportation is provided in the summer in many areas in the community for pick-up and return.

It is a nonprofit organization and is supported by the taxpayers of Tama and Toledo. STC REC is available to all youth in grades K-8 (depending on the sport) within the STC School District. The REC program strives to improve program availability, facilities, and equipment. Some past improvements include: adding a batting cage, scoreboards, and fencing improvements. STC REC is managed by a board of seven member/volunteers who meet regularly.</description></item><item><title>Schedules</title><link>https://stc-rec.tamatoledo.org/schedules/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 14:29:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://stc-rec.tamatoledo.org/schedules/</guid><description>Schedules will be updated on a seasonal basis.
